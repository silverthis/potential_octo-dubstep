Hello, team members. I am in here to try and maximize our accuracy.

Sometimes when we edit documents, then share them, we run into problems of "overwriting" or "duplicating" another members work.

We don't want to do that because, well, we're a team!

But, it happens.  So, you can see here that this is a platform for editing line items just like your home IDE such as notepad++ or sublime.
So, welcome, try this site out, and try creating a new "issue" which is another way of seeing "an edit" to the document (in this case, README.md).

Oh, and please label the name of each edit with something like, "README-edits # 3 - Damali" 

Peace...Love...Happiness.. Bron
